/* *An Array is a special variable , which can hold more one value;
Example-- const cars = ["Saab","Value","BMW"];

Why Use Array?-
               If you hava a list of items (a list of car names, for example),storing the cars in a single
               variable could look like this
   let car1 = "Saab";
   let car2 = "Volvo";
   let car3 = "BMW";
   
Creating an Array-
                  Using an Array literal is the easiest way to creating a Javascript Array;
Syntax:
const array_name = [item1,item2,....];
